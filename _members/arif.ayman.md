I'm Arif, currently diving into research with Vanessa at King's College London. I transitioned here after wrapping up my BSc in Biochemistry and an MSc in Microbiome in Health & Disease at the University of Warwick and King's College, respectively. My Masterâ€™s had me exploring the role of oral microbiota in infective endocarditis through systems biology approaches. I'm interested in bioniformatics and predictive modelling of diseases, delving deep into the potentials of the human microbiome as a biomaker. I'm about to begin my medical degree at the University of Warwick, where I'm excited to bridge the gap between systems biology-based disease modelling with hands-on diagnostic and clinical care.

Outside you might spot me on Brick Lane, St. James Park, or St. Pauls, playing chess. Come say hi, or shoot me an email at arifayman@aol.com
