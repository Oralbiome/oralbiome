I'm Arif, currently diving into research with Vanessa at King's College London. I transitioned here after completing my BSc in Biochemistry and now my Masterâ€™s had me exploring the role of oral microbiota in infective endocarditis using systems biology approaches. I'm interested in bioinformatics and predictive modeling of diseases, delving deep into the potential of the human microbiome as a biomarker. I'm about to begin my medical degree at the University of Warwick, where I'm excited to bridge the gap between systems biology-based disease modeling and hands-on diagnostic and clinical care.

Outside, you might spot me on Brick Lane, St. James Park, or St. Paul's, playing chess. Come say hi, or shoot me an email at arifayman@aol.com.
