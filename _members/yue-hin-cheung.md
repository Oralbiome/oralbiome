I am a third year student studying a biomedical science BSc at King's College London, with a focus on immunology. My dissertation looked at the effects of epithelial alarmins on a human mast cell line expressing the IL-17RB receptor. Over the summer, as part of the Sousa group, I will be performing pangenomic analysis of the saliva microbiome in patients with infective endocarditis, with a focus on Staphyloccus aureus. Outside of the lab, my current favourite hobbies are sleeping and messing around on a computer.
