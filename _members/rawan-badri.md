Greetings, I'm Rawanâ€”no, not Rowan (or related to Mr. Bean, for that matter). My journey has taken me from a diligent student pursuing a BSc in Dental Medicine in my homeland, Saudi Arabia, to mastering the intricacies of Periodontology at the esteemed University of Manchester. Now, I've embarked on a thrilling PhD adventure at Kingâ€™s College London, delving deep into the mysterious field of the oral microbiome as it dances with peri-implantitis â€“ that pesky inflammation lurking around dental implants.

When I'm not deciphering the mysteries of microbes, you can catch me wielding a pencil to craft detailed portraits, getting lost in captivating non-fiction books, or indulging my fictional side with a dash of anime. Whether you're curious about my research or simply want to discuss the finer points of character development in Kingâ€™s, I'm all earsâ€”or in this case, inbox. Feel free to reach out at rawan.badri@kcl.ac.uk. Let's connect and explore the realms of academia and beyond! ðŸ¦·ðŸ”¬ðŸŽ¨
