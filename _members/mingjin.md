I am Mingjin, a doctorate student at King's College London, currently under the supervision of Vanessa. Throughout my undergraduate studies, I actively engaged in research endeavors centered on pathogenic bacteria linked to periodontal disease, with a particular emphasis on oral Helicobacter pylori and gingival porphyrin.
Over the course of my undergraduate education, which spanned a period of five years, I developed a deep interest in the field of peri-implantitis. Presently, I am actively involved in a research undertaking at King's College London that centers on the utilization of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) methodologies within the domain of peri-implantitis prevention and treatment. The aim of this research is to provide a standardized approach that can successfully facilitate clinical practice in this field. If you possess an inclination towards my research, we can engage in a collaborative discussion pertaining to the subject at hand.The email address provided is mingjin.yao@kcl.ac.uk.
