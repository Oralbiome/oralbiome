I am Joe and I am one of Vanessa's PhD students at King's College London. In my previous studies I completed my BSc and MRes in Biological Sciences at Durham University. For my Master's, I looked into the model organism Drosophila Melanogaster where I studied the effect of 'knocking down' mucin genes on the gut microbiota. I have now moved my studies to a larger organism: humans! I am studying the link between the oral microbiome and a deadly heart condition called infective endocarditis. 

Outside of work I love to play/watch football, spending most of my time stressed about Newcastle United. I also enjoy swimming, cycling and running (not back to back though!) and walking through the parks that London and the surrounding areas have to offer! If you have any queries about the lab feel free to shoot me an email at joseph.falconer@kcl.ac.uk.
