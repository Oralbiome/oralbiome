Hello, Iâ€™m Tash and I am currently in my 4th year of medical school at King's College London. I recently completed an intercalated BSc in Regenerative Medicine and Innovation Technology, graduating with a First-Class Honours. During this time, I thoroughly enjoyed conducting a research project focussing on clinical and microbiological outcomes in infective endocarditis patients and in those with predisposing cardiac conditions with insights into the oral microbiome. It was a pleasure to work under the supervision of Vanessa Sousa Moreno and Joseph Falconer.
 
Outside of my studies I have a passion for travelling and exploration across different corners of the world. Looking ahead, my aspirations revolve around the idea of practicing medicine abroad and immersing myself into different global and healthcare encounters.
