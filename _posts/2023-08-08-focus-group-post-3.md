On the 8th of August 2023, we had our first public involevement panel. We discussed people's perception of infective endocarditis and the link to oral health. Also discussed was where and when people had learnt about infective endocarditis. There was a good number of people involved with members of the public, academics and clinical professionals all taking part! If you would like to find out more or would like to get involved next time, just send an email to joseph.falconer@kcl.ac.uk!
