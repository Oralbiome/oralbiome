# Oralbiome's Website

Welcome to the repository for Dr Vanessa Sousa's official website!

ABOUT US
We are a lab based at KCL in London looking to understand the links between oral health and systemic diseases. By integrating advanced multi-omics analyses and principles of systems biology, we aim to uncover the deeper, interconnected mechanisms that tie dental well-being to the broader landscape of human health.
