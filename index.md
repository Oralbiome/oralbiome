# About Us

<span style="font-size: 20px;">
We are a lab based at KCL in London looking to understand the links between oral health and systemic diseases. By integrating advanced multi-omics analyses and principles of systems biology, we aim to uncover the deeper, interconnected mechanisms that tie dental well-being to the broader landscape of human health.
